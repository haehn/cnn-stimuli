Hey! This is the source code for my experiments with four stimuli and neural networks.

This project is the code and results behind a bunch of experiments that were run on a cluster and aimed to see whether a computer knows how to classify a bunch of angles, lengths, positions and other things, and determine how it performed relative to humans.

This project replicates the experiments of Cleveland and McGill's 1985 paper entitled "Graphical Perception and Graphical Methods for Analyzing Scientific Data," except substituting convolutional neural networks for the human subjects.

Look in SLURMS/Figure5/LOGS/ to find the raw test outputs.
Look in RESULTS/ to find the raw network files.
Look in results.ipynb to see a few pretty graphs of all of the data.

Want to know what the stimuli look like on their own? Look in Figure5.ipynb.
Want to see a cute dog with a cool filter on it? Look in SOBEL DEMO.
Want to see the same network try to classify digits? Look in MNIST.

Have a look, enjoy...
