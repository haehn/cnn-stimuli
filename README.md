Hey! This is a README for this project.
Breaking the fourth wall, I guess.
Or the fourth stimulus.
Get it?

Anyway, this project is my attempt to run a bunch of experiments on a cluster that's not mine (don't worry, I was given permission)... and desperately try to understand all this stuff without looking like a complete idiot.
That was a little deep. Uh oh.

Four stimuli.
One neural network.
Who will win?
Look in SLURMS/Figure5/LOGS/ to find out.

Want to know what the stimuli look like (it's not that impressive)... ? Look in Figure5.ipynb.
Want to see a cute dog with a cool filter on it? Look in SOBEL DEMO.

Anyway.
README out.
I hope you read me.
