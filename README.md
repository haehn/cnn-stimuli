Hey! This is a README for this project.
Breaking the fourth wall, I guess.
Or the fourth stimulus.
Get it?

Anyway, this project is my attempt to run a bunch of experiments on a cluster that's not mine (don't worry, I was given permission) and see if a computer knows how to classify a bunch of angles, lengths, positions and other things. Human or computer: the age-old question.
In serious terms, this is replicating the experiments of Cleveland (not Grover) and McGill's 1985 paper entitled "Graphical Perception and Graphical Methods for Analyzing Scientific Data."

Four stimuli.
One neural network.
Who will win?
Look in SLURMS/Figure5/LOGS/ to find out.

Want to know what the stimuli look like (it's not that impressive)... ? Look in Figure5.ipynb.
Want to see a cute dog with a cool filter on it? Look in SOBEL DEMO.
